[VISOR](https://tyvancheng.github.io/Visor/)

VISOR is a web application that provides an autocomplete search bar for searching ticker symbols. It allows users to quickly search for specific stocks and provides a graphical representation of the stock's performance over various timeframes.

Features

Autocomplete Search Bar: The search bar provides an autocomplete feature, making it easy for users to find the desired ticker symbol quickly. It suggests matching stock symbols as the user types, enhancing the search experience.
Graphical Representation: Once a stock is selected, VISOR displays a graph illustrating the stock's performance. Users can choose from six different timeframes to view the historical data of the stock. The graph provides insights into the stock's price trends and helps users make informed decisions.
Future Plans

VISOR has exciting plans for future enhancements and additional functionality:

Customizable News Feeds: The application aims to incorporate news APIs to provide personalized and relevant news feeds related to the searched stock. Users will be able to stay updated with the latest news and events impacting their chosen stocks.
Stock Performance Calculator: VISOR plans to introduce a calculator similar to a beta calculator. It will calculate a number indicating the stock's relative performance compared to an index, such as the S&P 500. This feature will enable users to assess their stock's performance in comparison to the broader market.
Data Storage and Parsing: To improve performance and reduce API requests, VISOR intends to implement a local data storage mechanism. The application will store data fetched from APIs locally and parse it as needed when switching between different tabs. This approach will minimize API usage and provide faster access to historical stock data.
